# Exercises

1. Write a program that declares an integer variable called `i` with the value 20. Assign `i` to a floating-point
variable named `f`. Print out `i` and `f`.

2. Write a program that declares a constant called `value` that can be assigned to both an integer and a floating-point
variable. Assign it to an integer called `i` and a floating-point variable called `f`. Print out `i` and `f`.

3. Write a program with three variables, one named `b` of type `byte`, one named `smallI` of type `int32`, and one named
`bigI` of type `uint64`. Assign each variable the maximum legal value for its type; then add 1 to each variable. Print
out their values.
